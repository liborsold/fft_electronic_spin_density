Physics background
===============================

- introduce

Neutron scattering
----------------------------

- form-factor approximation leads to a Fourier transform
- motivation for cuprates?

vs 

- full including overlap term


Fourier transform (in general)
----------------------------------------

- FT of two displaced objects
