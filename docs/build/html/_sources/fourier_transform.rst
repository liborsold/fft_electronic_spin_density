Fourier transform
==================================================

Note that the dominant feature in the INS spectra, which is the stratification 
due to the :math:`\left(1-\cos \left(\vec{k} \cdot \vec{r}_{a b}\right)\right)` term, 
arises in general for any Fourier transform of a repeated displaced object.

- resolution and system size are reciprocal quantities in real and reciprocal space
- show how the zero-padding is used to increase the resolution of the FFT
